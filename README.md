# Prototype.app

Streamlit-based stock monitoring dashboard for tracking live market data, charts, order books, alerts, and news from a single page.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Recommended: virtual environment (``python -m venv .venv``)

## Installation
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\\Scripts\\activate`
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   The same dependency list is also defined in `Mason/pyproject.toml`, so `pip install .` works if you prefer editable installs.

## Running the app
Launch the Streamlit dashboard from the repository root:
```bash
streamlit run Mason/app.py
```

If you prefer (for example, inside Codespaces where the `Run` button executes a Python file), you can invoke the script directly thanks to the embedded bootstrapper:
```bash
python Mason/app.py
```
Both commands require the dependencies from `requirements.txt` to be installed first.

## Working locally (without Codespaces)
If the browser-based Codespaces editor feels slow or shows large pending change counts, you can work on the project locally instead:

1. **Clone the repository** on your machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Scottie-7/Prototype.app.git
   cd Prototype.app
   ```
2. **Create a feature branch** before making edits so `main` remains clean:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```
3. **Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies** (same as above):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the app locally**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run Mason/app.py
   ```
   Streamlit will open a browser window on `http://localhost:8501` with the dashboard.

When you finish a set of changes, commit them locally (`git commit`) and push your branch (`git push origin my-feature`) to open a pull request from a clean history.

## Troubleshooting large change counts
If Git shows thousands of files ready to commit, check for the following:

- You may have opened or extracted the `Mason.zip` archive. The repository already contains the extracted sources inside `Mason/`, so you can delete any accidentally-created `Mason/` copies or large temporary directories with `git clean -fd`.
- Binary artifacts generated by Streamlit (e.g., `.streamlit` cache directories) can be safely removed before committing: `rm -rf ~/.streamlit/cache`. Those locations are ignored by default when running locally but can appear in Codespaces if created outside the repo root.
- Run `git status` to identify the exact paths marked as modified. If they aren't part of your change, discard them with `git checkout -- <path>` or revert everything with `git reset --hard` (be carefulâ€”this removes uncommitted work).

Working locally avoids the latency of Codespaces and gives you more direct control over Git commits and branch management.

## Optional configuration
Set the following environment variables before launching the app if you want email/SMS notifications to work:
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`

## Quick validation
To confirm the source files compile:
```bash
python -m py_compile Mason/app.py
```
